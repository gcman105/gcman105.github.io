## Recommended image size for your website

Website images that are too big, will not only create issues with the user experience on your site, but will affect your SEO strategy *(loading speed, bounce rate, ranking, etc)*.

### Recommended size: 1920x1080px, jpeg, saved for web at 72 DPI

Note that devices have different ratio than the one you shoot and it is possible your images will be cropped when viewed on web. As a recommendation try to shoot wider shots than usual for your web content, to avoid cropping of important image content.
